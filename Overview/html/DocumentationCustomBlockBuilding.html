<p>A building consists of multiple apartments and each apartment consists of multiple rooms. Each room is modelled as air thermal mass with other physics added to it as custom components (radiators, underfloor piping, walls, and roof/floors). The block allows you to analyze building HVAC requirements, design your BEMS, and evaluate energy usage during real world operational scenarios.</p>
<p>This block defines all geometrical properties of a 3D building and the solar loading on it over a specified period of time. It contains all the essential information to build a thermal network for simulating a building physics. A pictorial representation and connection of different building components is given below. The block has ports:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Port <b>H</b> is the thermal node to connect the building to the environment. This node connects the building wall and roof models to the <b>Ambient</b> custom component model.</li>
<li>Port <b>G</b> is the thermal node to connect the building to the ground. This node connects the floor of the 1st level in a building to the ground. Heat loss through the ground is modelled using this node.</li>
<li>Port <b>Li</b> is a bundle of Simscape Thermal Liquid nodes, with one Thermal Liquid node per room in the building. It represents the heating or cooling fluid inlet port to the room.</li>
<li>Port <b>Lo</b> is a bundle of Simscape Thermal Liquid nodes, with one Thermal Liquid node per room in the building. It represents the heating or cooling fluid outlet port from the room.</li>
<li>Input port <b>C</b> is a scalar input, varying between 0-1, to specify the cloud coverage level. To model a cloudless sky, set C to 0. To set a very cloudy sky, set C to 1. The <b>Ambient</b> custom component block provides input for port <b>C</b>.</li>
<li>Input port <b>V</b> is a scalar matrix, to specify valve closure level for each room. The matrix size equals the number of rooms in the building. Each row of the matrix specifies the apartment number, while the column specifies the room number. Each room could have different values for valve closure, ranging between 0-1. Set the elements of V to 0 to close the valves carrying fluid to the room. Set the elements of V to 1 to fully open the valve carrying heating/cooling fluid to the room. This port is visible only when you set the block mask parameter <b>Select room modelling option</b> to <tt>HVAC: Room Radiator Only</tt>, or <tt>HVAC: Room Underfloor Heating/Cooling Only</tt>, or <tt>HVAC: Room Radiator with Underfloor Heating/Cooling</tt>.</li>
<li>Port <b>S</b> is a scalar matrix input port, to specify heat addition to each room.</li>
<li>Ports <b>Tr</b> and <b>Tw</b> are outputs for the room and the wall temperatures.</li>

% Heating/Cooling|. The 1st two options, |Thermal Load| and |Thermal 
% Requirements| are selected during HVAC requirement analysis for the 
% building. The last 3 options enable you to add radiator, or under-floor
% pipes, or both, to your room for heating or cooling. These 3 fidilities 
% are preferred for BEMS analysis and control design. If you select any of
% these last 3 options, you will need to specify |Room Physics| parameters 
% too. To learn more about the room modelling options, see 
% <matlab:open('DocumentationRoomModellingOptions.html') Room Modelling 
% Options in Building Custom Component>.
% * *Roof to ambient contact area matrix*, |roofEnvConnMat|, specified as a
% matrix with 3 columns and number of rows equal to the number of rooms at 
% top floor level. Each row of data is the information on area connectivity 
% between a room and the environment, through the roof. Column 1 and 2 specify
% the apartment and room number; column 3 specifies, in square meters, the
% area of the roof of the room.
% * *Roof hourly-solar-radiation matrix*, |roofEnvSolarRad|, specified as a
% matrix of scalar values. The total number of rows is equal to the total
% number of roofs defined in the building, which is the row size of 
% |roofEnvConnMat|. The total number of columns is equal to the number of 
% hours the solar radiation is computed. Each column data represents solar 
% radiation data at an instance of time, on the roof of the building. If 
% the block has been parameterized for 10 days of solar radiation, then the 
% number of columns must be equal to 10 x 24 = 240.
% 
% These two parameters appear when *Select room modelling option* to |HVAC: 
% Room Radiator Only|, or |HVAC: Room Underfloor Heating/Cooling Only|, or 
% |HVAC: Room Radiator with Underfloor Heating/Cooling|. When you select 
% one of these options, a thermal liquid (TL) array of nodes port also 
% appears on the block mask. Each thermal node is connected to one room in 
% the building, or the number of thermal nodes is equal to the total number 
% of rooms defined in the building.
% 
% * *Room radiator projection area matrix*, |roomRadiatorArea|, specified
% as matrix of scalar values. The number of rows and columns of this
% matrix is equal to the *Number of apartments* and *Number of rooms*
% parameters. The matrix stores the surface area of radiator in each room.
% * *Room under floor piping area matrix*, |roomUFPipingArea|, specified as
% a matrix of scalar values. The number of rows and columns of this
% matrix is equal to the *Number of apartments* and *Number of rooms*
% parameters. The matrix stores the surface area of underfloor piping 
% defined in each room.
%% Room Physics
% You only need to parameterize this section when you set *Select room 
% modelling option* to |HVAC: Room Radiator Only|, |HVAC: Room Underfloor 
% Heating/Cooling Only|, or |HVAC: Room Radiator with Underfloor 
% Heating/Cooling|.
%
% * *Radiator pipe gap in layout*, |radiatorPipeGap|, specified as a scalar
% value. This parameter defines the gap between pipe outer surfaces in a radiator.
% * *Radiator pipe hydraulic diameter*, |radiatorPipeHydrDia|, specified as a
% scalar value. This parameter defines the radiator pipe hydraulic diameter.
% * *Radiator pipe cross-sectional area*, |radiatorPipeArea|, specified as a
% scalar value. This parameter defines the radiator pipe cross-sectional area.
% * *Under floor pipe hydraulic diameter*, |UFPipeHydrDia|, specified as a scalar
% value. This parameter defines the under floor piping diameter.
% * *Under floor pipe gap in layout*, |UFPipeGap|, specified as a scalar
% value. This parameter defines the gap between pipe puter surfaces in underfloor
% layout.
% * *Under floor pipe cross-sectional area*, |UFPipeArea|, specified as a scalar
% value. This parameter defines the under floor pipe cross-sectional area.
% 
%% Wall Properties
% * *Select wall property option*, |wallPropValue|, is a drop down list
% that enables you to specify all wall properties as either same, |All 
% Walls with Same Properties|, or different, |Different Walls with Different 
% Properties|. 
% * *Wall material density*, |wallMaterialDen|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Wall material heat capacity*, |wallMaterialCp|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Wall absorptivity*, |wallAbsorptivity|, specified as a scalar value.
% * *Wall thermal conductivity*, |wallThermalK|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Wall thickness*, |wallThickness|, specified as a scalar value.
%
% When |Different Walls with Different Properties| is selected, it lets you  
% specify above properties for external walls, internal walls, floors, and 
% roof, separately.
%
%% Window Glass Properties
% * *Window material density*, |winMaterialDen|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Window material heat capacity*, |winMaterialCp|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Window Absorptivity*, |winAbsorptivity|, specified as a scalar value.
% * *Window thermal conductivity*, |winThermalK|, specified as a scalar
% value.
% * *Window thickness*, |winThickness|, specified as a scalar value.
% * *Window transmissivity*, |winTransmissivity|, specified as a scalar
% value.
%
%% Heat Transfer
% * *Cooling / heating pipe roughness*, |heatTransferPipeRoughness|,
% specified as a scalar value.
% * *Effective heat transfer coefficient from ambient to wall surface*,
% |extToWallHTC|, specified as a scalar value.
% * *Effective heat transfer coefficient from internal surface to the
% room*, |intToRoomHTC|, specified as a scalar value.
% * *Initial temperature*, |iniTemperature|, specified as a scalar value.
